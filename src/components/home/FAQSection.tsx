      question: "Class Schedule & Attendance",
      answer: "Classes are scheduled at mutually agreed times between student and instructor. Missed classes are not rescheduled unless valid prior notice is given (minimum 6 hours before the scheduled time). Classes cancelled by the instructor will always be rescheduled at a convenient time for the student. Regular attendance is crucial for steady progress in learning the violin."
    },
    {
      question: "Fee Structure & Payments",
      answer: "Monthly fees are due on or before the 1st day of each month. Fees are non-refundable except in serious cases such as prolonged illness or relocation. Payments can be made via UPI, Google Pay, or Bank Transfer. Late payments will receive a single reminder, after which classes may be suspended until payment is received. New students may be required to pay a one-time registration fee."
    },
    {
      question: "Practice & Progress",
      answer: "Regular practice is essential for mastering the violin. Students are expected to practice at least 30 minutes daily. Weekly assignments must be completed before the next class. Progress is monitored through monthly assessments, and additional practice materials are provided for areas needing improvement. Parents of younger students are encouraged to supervise practice sessions."
    },
    {
      question: "Materials & Recordings",
      answer: "All learning materials including PDFs, audio recordings, and instructional videos are provided for personal use only. Redistribution or sharing these materials with non-enrolled students is strictly prohibited. Students receive access to a dedicated online portal containing lesson materials, practice tracks, and performance examples. Additional resources are regularly added to support learning."
    },
    {
      question: "Online Class Policy",
      answer: "For online classes, students must keep their video ON throughout the session unless specifically instructed otherwise. A stable internet connection with minimum 2 Mbps speed is required. The camera should be positioned to clearly show the student's posture, both hands, and the violin. Background noise should be minimized, and a pair of earphones/headphones is recommended for better sound quality."
    },
    {
      question: "Performance & Participation",
      answer: "Participation in concerts and recitals is based on merit and preparedness. Students who demonstrate consistent progress and dedication will be invited to perform. Some classes may be recorded for quality review and development of teaching materials. Selected student performances may be featured on the academy's social media platforms with prior consent."
    },
    {
      question: "Rewards & Certifications",
      answer: "Points are awarded for regular attendance, consistent practice, and improvement. Students who accumulate sufficient points receive quarterly rewards such as special masterclass access or performance opportunities. Milestone certificates are awarded upon completion of specific learning modules or grade levels. Annual recognition is given to outstanding students based on their dedication and progress."
    },
    {
      question: "Referral Policy",
      answer: "Current students who refer a new student will receive a â‚¹500 reward after the referred student completes one month of lessons. Multiple referrals are encouraged and rewarded individually. Referred students also receive a 5% discount on their first month's fees. This policy aims to build a community of dedicated violin learners."
    },
    {
      question: "Discontinuation Policy",
      answer: "Students wishing to discontinue classes must provide at least one week's advance notice. This allows for proper closure of the learning process and completion of pending modules. The academy reserves the right to terminate enrollment in cases of excessive absenteeism, misconduct, or consistent lack of practice. In such cases, a counseling session will be conducted before final termination."
